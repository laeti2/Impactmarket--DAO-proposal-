# TITLE
Governance rewards

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Implementing governance rewards for people who participate the most to the DAO. The purpose is to incentivize PACT holders to be more involved in the evolution of impactMarket.

# SCOPE
The objective is to give governance rewards for token holders who participate in the governance of the platform by voting on proposals or making other contributions to the DAO. These rewards would incentivize holders to actively participate in the decision-making process of the DAO.
By offering rewards to those who participate in the governance of the DAO, the program can encourage more community members to get involved in decision-making processes. In addition, the governance rewards can attract and retain more active and committed community members, who are invested in the success of the DAO and its missions. It incentivizes community members to act in the best interests of the DAO and its users, rather than their own individual interests. Offering governance rewards thus can lead to more diverse perspectives and more robust discussions, ultimately resulting in better decisions for the impactMarket platform and its users.
From the point of view of investors and traders who invested in the PACT token through buying or trading it, the implementation could also be beneficial. First, governance rewards can potentially increase the value of the PACT token. As more traders participate in the governance of the project, and as the DAO makes decisions that are beneficial to its users and stakeholders, the value of the token may increase, potentially leading to higher returns for investors who hold the token. Finally, investors who hold PACT tokens can use their tokens to participate in the DAO's governance. By doing so, they can have a direct impact on the direction and decision-making of the DAO, potentially leading to outcomes that are more favorable to their interests.
In conclusion, implementing governance reward could be beneficial for both the donors, the beneficiaries and the investors.
